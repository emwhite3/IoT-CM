# this is the python file we are using to simulate the grid
# just create a 10 x 10 grid 
# the rules are you can only mode up down left and right
# you can only see an obstacle if you move next to an obstacle
# add the obstacle to the printed grid if they can see an obstacle by being in a square next to an obstacle
# the goal is to get to a given coordinate

# recreate the grid in the slides presentation
